Diabetes_Project

  This project completes part of the final assessment in HarvardX's Professional Certificate in Data Science. It explores data on patients from Sylhet Diabetic Hospital. The main focus is to construct a model to predict whether a patient is at risk of being diabetic.

main_code.R

  This is the main R scrips which loads and visualises the data and constructs the models. this script requires that the file diabetes_data_upload.csv is in the working    (project) directory. The data is included in this repo and relative file paths (in line with the repo) are used to load the data.


final_report.rmd

  This is the final report in .Rmd form. The files which are loaded are created in main_code.R. Because the script takes a while to run, all of the R objects and images    required to run this report are included in the folder rmd_files. This folder must be present in the working (project) directory. Again, relative file paths in line      with this repo are used to load the files. This report is also available through this RPubs link.


final_report.pdf

  This is the final report in PDF format.
